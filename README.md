Nature Inspired solution to data pre-processing for population growth prediction

Our goal is to combine machine learning and nature
inspired computing to predict the population growth of
different countries of the world. This project is an experiment
in which a few nature inspired algorithms will be applied to a
dataset as a step in data preprocessing in a machine learning
environment.

To contribute, you may copy the repository to your machine. Add a class of the algorithm in a .py file and then use it inside final code for testing with ready models.

GP.py: genetic programming for feature transformation
PSO.py: Multicollinearity with sko.PSO implementation
init_data: dynamic data retriever
preprocessing: static data retriever
